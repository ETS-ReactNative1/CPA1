Application Name: Alumni Connect

Elevator Pitch: Many students in universities are lost in the pathways they can take while pursuing their studies. Students have pressing questions such as what are the most relevant skills employees are looking for and what are the vital courses that a student has to take in order to succeed in the working world. The Alumni Connect platform would help bridge the gap between past alumni and current students. By having short 15 minutes video conversation, many of these questions could be ironed out. This bridge would help students become more confident when they go out into the working world.
